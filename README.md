<h1>Requirements testing</h1>
✅ Initialise a shuffled single deck of cards
✅ Provide a button that will 'draw' a card from that deck
✅ Display an image of the newly drawn card, with an image of the previous card to its left (if there is no previous card, display a placeholder)
✅ If the value of the newly drawn card matches the previous one, display the message SNAP VALUE!
✅ If the suit of the newly drawn card matches the previous one, display the message SNAP SUIT!
✅ If neither the value nor suit match, display no message
✅ Once all 52 cards have been drawn, remove the button and instead display the total number of value matches and the total number of suit matches
✅ A counter, displaying the current card number (or how many cards are left) - e.g. Card 12 of 52 or 29 cards remaining
❌ The probability that the next card drawn will either be a value or suit match (this requires keeping track of what cards have already been drawn)
❌ Some animation and/or sound effects
